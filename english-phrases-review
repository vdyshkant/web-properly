How does JavaScript deal with this
so you have a few traps to watch out for
All that’s been said
they work just as well
the code more difficult for humans to read
we haven’t indented the code.
This is quite tricky to describe with words
you don’t end up with an

Failing that, you have a final

Plus it also saves JavaScript from
this makes it simpler
You can achieve this
and therefore harder to understand and debug
unless you have a particularly tricky condition to evaluate

We did so simply for demonstration purposes
Thus
you ensure that

Let’s break down the condition

JavaScript offers a better alternative
but it’s a little verbose and can be quite confusing
there is an outer if statement
one nested inside another
One way of doing this

The end result is the same
things that make no difference to the final result
Otherwise
operator acts on two boolean values
If either of the conditions
if the left‐hand side is false, JavaScript doesn’t even bother checking the right‐hand side and just returns a result of false
wasting time
it’s worth noting that JavaScript doesn’t like doing unnecessary work
Although
In any other circumstance, the result will be false
operator actually produces a result
This is very similar
which again is evaluated to either true or false
and this can be evaluated as true or false

usually
So if it seems a bit confusing on first read, don’t
panic. All will become clear.

You should have a general idea
any number besides 0 and NaN converts to true
which is then implicitly converted to a boolean
Worse still
code extract

braces are required
the only code to execute is the first line below the if statement

how did this alter the if statement

This is not necessary, but it is a good practice to get into
